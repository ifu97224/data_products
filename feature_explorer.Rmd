## Introducing the Feature Explorer App

<style>
strong {
  font-weight: bold;
}
</style>

*  The Feature Explorer App has been developed to allow users to upload any data file of their choosing and create presentation quality visualizations

*  The following plots can be generated using the App:

     a.) **Scatterplots:**  X and Y variables can be chosen as well as color and facet variables.  Linear smoothing lines can also be added
     
     b.) **Boxplots:**  X and Y variables can be chosen
     
     c.) **Histograms:** X variable can be chosen, number of bins can be selected and density lines can be added

## Importing Data

*  The App allows the user to upload any data file of their choosing and includes controls to allow for different delimiters and whether the file includes headers

*  The App also requires the user to upload a meta data file containing descriptions of the variables and whether they should be treated as continuous or factors

## Plotting Data

*  The charts below are examples of plots that can be created using the App:

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.width=13, fig.height=6}

library(gridExtra)

a <- ggplot(mtcars,aes(mpg,hp)) +
           geom_point(color="orange") +  
           theme_bw(base_family = "Arial") + 
           ggtitle("Scatterplot of MPG by Horsepower") + 
           xlab("MPG") + 
           ylab("Horsepower") +
           theme(axis.title.y=element_text(vjust=1), 
                 axis.title.x=element_text(vjust=-0.5),
                 plot.title=element_text(vjust=1)) +
          geom_smooth(size = 1, linetype = 2, method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red")

b <- ggplot(mtcars,aes(factor(cyl), mpg)) +
        geom_boxplot(fill="orange") +
        theme_bw(base_family = "Arial") + 
        ggtitle("Boxplot of MPG by Number of Cylinders") +
        xlab("Number of Cylinders") + 
        ylab("MPG") +
        theme(axis.title.y=element_text(vjust=1), 
              axis.title.x=element_text(vjust=-0.5),
              plot.title=element_text(vjust=1))

grid.arrange(a,b,ncol=2)

```

## Planned Future Developments

<style>
em {
  font-style: italic
}
</style>

*  Creating a correlation matrix and variable cluster tree to understand the relationships between the variables
*  Developing an interface to allow users to bin and transform variables and add them to the uploaded data set
*  Allowing the user to choose a *target* variable and to rank variables in order of their importance in predicting the chosen *target*.  The user will be able to choose from multiple methods of ranking including:

     a.)  Random Forest Importance
     
     b.)  Squared Correlations
     
     c.)  T-Tests
     
     d.)  Chi-Squared Tests
     
     e.)  Univariate regression
